# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Summary
We learned implement two circuits using minterms and maxterms from given truth tables, then assigned the logic through the top file and assign the physical parts through the constraints file.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.
It assigns the logic to the device. It is basically the bridge between the software and the hardware.

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.
It implements the physical location of each switch and light.

### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?
Even if we grouped it differently, as long as we still grouped the correct terms, we should still get the same output. The only difference would be the statements would be longer and more complex.
